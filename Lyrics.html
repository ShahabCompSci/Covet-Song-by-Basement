                When I'm with you
                I don't want to be with you

                White hair
                And a hopeful smile
                Your inside
                Is on your outside
                I need
                A pleasant surprise

                Good heart and desire to please
                I want a fatal disease

                With you
                I don't want to be with you
                When I'm with you
                I don't want to be with you

                You are
                Everything
                My most
                Demanding dream
                
                Good heart and desire to please
                I want a fatal diseases
                With you
                I don't want to be with you
                When I'm with you
                I don't want to be with you
                When I'm with you
                I don't want to be with you
                When I'm with you
                I don't want to be with you
            </pre>
